# 🐶 Dog Breed Classifier – AI Powered Web App

🔗 **Live App:** https://dogbreedclassifier-31.streamlit.app/

A modern **AI-powered web application** that predicts the **dog breed** from an uploaded image using a **deep learning Vision Transformer (ViT)** model.  
Built with **Streamlit + PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers**, this project demonstrates an end-to-end **machine learning deployment** workflow.

## 📊 How It Works

1. User uploads a dog image  
2. Image is preprocessed using Hugging Face `AutoImageProcessor`  
3. Vision Transformer predicts class probabilities  
4. Top-5 predictions are extracted  
5. Results are displayed with confidence scores
